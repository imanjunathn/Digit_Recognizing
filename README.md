# Digit_Recognizing

Recognizing multi-digit numbers in photographs captured at street level is an 
important component of modern-day map making.

SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing machine learning and object recognition algorithms with minimal requirement on data formatting but comes  from a significantly harder, unsolved, real world problem (recognizing digits and  numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in  Google Street View images.
